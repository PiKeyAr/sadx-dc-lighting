*sadx-dc-lighting* is a mod for Sonic Adventure DX PC which implements the palette-based lighting engine (known as the Lantern Engine) from Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast.

This mod requires [d3d8to9](https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9) to convert the DirectX 8 renderer to DirectX 9, as it uses HLSL Shader Model 3.
